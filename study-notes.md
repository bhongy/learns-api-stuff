## [Intro to Node/Express by Eric Elliott](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/introduction-to-node-express-90c431f9e6fd)

### Tips on:
- using env variables
- setting `NODE_PATH` to avoid long `../..` require
- memory management for temporary user data (single threaded)
- debugging with Chrome
- handling Uncaught Exceptions
  > You must shut down the process when there is an uncaught exception, because by definition, if you donâ€™t know what went wrong with the app, your app is in an unknown, undefined state, and just about anything could be going wrong.
