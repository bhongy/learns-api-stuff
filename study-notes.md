## [Intro to Node/Express by Eric Elliott](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/introduction-to-node-express-90c431f9e6fd)

### Tips on:
- using env variables
- setting `NODE_PATH` to avoid long `../..` require
- memory management for temporary user data (single threaded)
- debugging with Chrome
- handling Uncaught Exceptions
  > You must shut down the process when there is an uncaught exception, because by definition, if you donâ€™t know what went wrong with the app, your app is in an unknown, undefined state, and just about anything could be going wrong.

- using `process.nextTick` is more performant than `setTimeout(fn, 0)` because `nextTick` doesn't need to access i/o
- `node --trace_gc <file.js>` will output garbage collection activities to the console.
- `Buffer.slice` creates a new reference that points to the part of the original buffer so `Buffer.write` to the sliced buffer will also mutate the original.
- `curl ... | json_pp` to pretty format JSON response
